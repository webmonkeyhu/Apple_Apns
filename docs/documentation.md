# AppleApns

## Introduction
`Webmonkey\Apple\Apns` provides a client for the Apple Push Notification Service. `Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Client` allows you to send data from servers to your iOS Applications.

In order to leverage APNS you **must** follow the [Provisioning and Development steps outlined by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html).

The service is composed of 3 distinct parts:
- The Clients:
  - Feedback: `Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Client\Feedback`
  - Message: `Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Client\Message`
- The Message: `Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Message\Alert`
- The Responses:
  - Feedback: `Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Response\Feedback`
  - Message: `Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Response\Message`

The Clients is the broker that sends the message to the APNS server and returns the response. The Message is where you define all of the message specific data that you would like to send for the alert. The Response is the feedback given back from the APNS server.

## Quick Start

In order to send messages; you must have completed the provisioning and deployment steps mentioned above. Once you have your certificates in place you will be able to prepare to send messages to your iOS application. Here we will setup the client and prepare to send out messages.

```
use Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Client\Message as Client;
use Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Message;
use Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Message\Alert;
use Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Response\Message as Response;
use Webmonkey\Apple\Exception\RuntimeException;

$client = new Client();
$client->open(Client::SANDBOX_URI, '/path/to/push-certificate.pem', 'optionalPassPhrase');
```

So now that we have the client setup and available, it is time to define out the message that we intend to send to our iOS tokens that have registered for push notifications on our server. Note that many of the methods specified are not required but are here to give an inclusive look into the message.

```
$message = new Message();
$message->setId('my_unique_id');
$message->setToken('DEVICE_TOKEN');
$message->setBadge(5);
$message->setSound('bingbong.aiff');

// simple alert:
$message->setAlert('Bob wants to play poker');
// complex alert:
$alert = new Alert();
$alert->setBody('Bob wants to play poker');
$alert->setActionLocKey('PLAY');
$alert->setLocKey('GAME_PLAY_REQUEST_FORMAT');
$alert->setLocArgs(array('Jenna', 'Frank'));
$alert->setLaunchImage('Play.png');
$message->setAlert($alert);
```

Now that we have the message taken care of, all we need to do next is send out the message. Each message comes back with a set of data that allows us to understand what happened with our push notification as well as throwing exceptions in the cases of server failures.

```
try {
    $response = $client->send($message);
} catch (RuntimeException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
    exit(1);
}
$client->close();

if ($response->getCode() !== Response::RESULT_OK) {
     switch ($response->getCode()) {
         case Response::RESULT_PROCESSING_ERROR:
             // you may want to retry
             break;
         case Response::RESULT_MISSING_TOKEN:
             // you were missing a token
             break;
         case Response::RESULT_MISSING_TOPIC:
             // you are missing a message id
             break;
         case Response::RESULT_MISSING_PAYLOAD:
             // you need to send a payload
             break;
         case Response::RESULT_INVALID_TOKEN_SIZE:
             // the token provided was not of the proper size
             break;
         case Response::RESULT_INVALID_TOPIC_SIZE:
             // the topic was too long
             break;
         case Response::RESULT_INVALID_PAYLOAD_SIZE:
             // the payload was too large
             break;
         case Response::RESULT_INVALID_TOKEN:
             // the token was invalid; remove it from your system
             break;
         case Response::RESULT_UNKNOWN_ERROR:
             // apple didn't tell us what happened
             break;
     }
}
```

## Feedback Service
APNS has a feedback service that you must listen to. Apple states that they monitor providers to ensure that they are listening to this service.

The feedback service simply returns an array of Feedback responses. All tokens provided in the feedback should not be sent to again; unless the device re-registers for push notification. You can use the time in the Feedback response to ensure that the device has not re-registered for push notifications since the last send.

```
use Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Client\Feedback as Client;
use Webmonkey\Apple\Apns\Response\Feedback as Response;
use Webmonkey\Apple\Exception\RuntimeException;

$client = new Client();
$client->open(Client::SANDBOX_URI, '/path/to/push-certificate.pem', 'optionalPassPhrase');
$responses = $client->feedback();
$client->close();

foreach ($responses as $response) {
    echo $response->getTime() . ': ' . $response->getToken();
}
```
